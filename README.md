# [Built By Moroccan Devs](http://builtbymoroccandevs.com)

A place for Moroccan developers to showcase their awesome projects.

We think it might be a good idea to have a site listing all the cool projects built by Moroccan developers so we can showcase their talent to the world, and bring the Moroccan community together.

## Submissions
We are trying to keep the site submission quality as high as possible. Please only submit real world applications.

## How to submit
To submit a site suggestions, [open an issue](https://github.com/arkhamdev/built-by-moroccan-devs/issues/new) or create a pull request.

Make sure the screenshot is **1000x800** and please double check that everything looks good before submitting. It's also a good idea to run the screenshot through an image optimizer like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) before including it. This will help keep the website fast and the repository small as possible.

## TODO
* Add link to creator of the project
